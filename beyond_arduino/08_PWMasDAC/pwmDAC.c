 * Source code for producing a PWM generated sine wave signal.  We'll use the 
 * Fast PWM Mode of Timer/Counter 0.  
 *
 * Note:
 * This is a VERY simple way of generating an analog, repetitive signal (in this
 * case a sine wave, but could be any arbitrary waveform).  The main limitation
 * is the frequency of the signal cannot be changed.
 *
 * The frequency of the produced sine wave is fixed at about 244Hz which is
 * 62500, the PWM frequency divided by 256, the number of points in the sine
 * table.

/* This is the sine table.  Each value represents a voltage level on a

   This uses up a lot of RAM because this is where it is stored.  Could be moved
   to FLASH, but would require more overhead to get the data out. */
